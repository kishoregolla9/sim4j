\section{Wireless Sensor Networks}

A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a set of nodes tasked with sensing environmental phenomenon at or near each node.  Nodes communicate wirelessly to send their data back to a central acquisition system.  Nodes are typically small, cheap devices and are designed with power efficiency in mind to prolong the lifetime of the network's ability to collect data.  Nodes are often distributed in the field of interest randomly, sometimes even by dropping them from the air, as on a military battlefield.  Other times, they are placed in specifici, but unknown apriori, locations, as in placing them in bird nests\cite{birds}.  They may be rolled into a transportation tunnel to give firefighters and emergecny crews a current information about heat and oxygen levents \cite{runes}.
