I would like to thank Professor Thomas Kunz for his guidance and encouragement that made this research possible.  Further, I would like to thank Li Li whom, along with Professor Kunz, performed the initial CCA research and wrote the basis for the Matlab simulations used in this thesis.  Finally, my colleagues Shafagh Alikhani and Ben Gardiner who provided a tireless ear to listen to ideas throughout the process.
