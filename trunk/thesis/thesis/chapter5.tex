\chapter{Avoiding the Worst Anchor Node Placements}
\label{chap:outliers}
As seen in the previous chapter, there are some anchor node placements that are significantly worse than the average case.   In this chapter, we explore in more detail the cause of these outliers and more importantly, is this condition detectable in the real world.

\section{Effects of Procrustes Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:outlier1} shows a network map of an example outlier anchor node placement for a random network. A line is drawn between the real location and the calculated location for each individual node.  The length of this line is the location error.  For comparison, Figure~\ref{fig:normal1} is a randomly chosen non-outlier case, where the node difference lines are short, representing low localization error.  However, in the outlier case, the node difference lines criss-cross the network along a clear, single angle.  This visual representation suggests the reflection component of the final linear transformation is to blame for the extremely poor, outlier results.

\subsection{Transformation Reflection and Rotation}
\label{sec:reflection}
Unfortunately, simply disabling the reflection component of the Procrustes transformation algorithm does not solve the problem.  The output of the Procrustes algorithm is a linear transformation which includes a rotation or reflection matrix, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:procrustes}.  If the determinant of that matrix is +1, then the resulting transformation has a rotation, with an angle as in Equation~\ref{eqn:rotmatrix}.  

\begin{equation}
	\det{(T)}=+1 \Rightarrow ~Rotation ~with ~T=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} \\ 
	\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta}\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eqn:rotmatrix} 
\end{equation}

If the determinant is -1, then the resulting transformation has reflection component, across a line at an angle as shown in Equation~\ref{eqn:refmatrix}. 

\begin{equation}
	\det{(T)}=-1 \Rightarrow ~Reflection ~with ~T=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\cos{2{\theta}} & \sin{2{\theta}} \\ 
	\sin{2{\theta}} & -\cos{2{\theta}}\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eqn:refmatrix} 
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:rotref} shows the rotation and reflection distributions of two different networks, for a random set of anchor sets for each network.  In both networks, and with consistency across others, the bulk of the data points have the same angle of either rotation or reflection, while the outliers have the opposite property with a wide variance in the angle.  However, in different networks, it is not consistently either rotation or reflection.  Therefore, relying on the determinant of the transformation is not a sufficient indicator for a network designer knowing that an outlier case has been detected and that the localization results are essentially useless.

\subsection{Transformation Scaling and Translation}

For completeness, we explore the possibility that the scaling or translation component of the linear transformation is causing the issue.  In Figure~\ref{fig:scalar}, the scale component, \emph{b}, of the Procrustes analysis is plotted against the mean location error for the same two networks as shown above for rotation and reflection.  While there is an apex of the data around a particular scalar value where the minimum localization error is seen, the outliers can also have this same scalar value.  Therefore, the scaling component is not a good indicator of  extremely poor localization performance.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
	\subfloat[]{\label{fig:scalar1}
		\includegraphics[width=\figurewidth\textwidth]{chapter5/a/TransformScalar}}
\\

		\includegraphics[width=\figurewidth\textwidth]{chapter5/b/TransformScalar}}
	\caption{Transformation scalar component versus location error}	
	\label{fig:scalar}
\end{figure}

Likewise, Figure~\ref{fig:translate} plots the horizontal, \emph{x}, and vertical, \emph{y}, translation components, \emph{c}, against the mean location error. As with the other transformation components, there is single \emph{natural} value that gives best localization performance.  However, much like for the scaling factor, while outlier localization errors are the only values that occur away from this natural value, the outliers also occur around that value as well.  Therefore, it is not possible to classify a anchor set as one of the outlier cases based on the translation component of the linear transformation it produces.

	\caption{Transformation translation component versus location error}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Procrustes Dissimilarity}

The Procrustes algorithm itself provides a measure of the dissimilarity.  Specifically, it is the minimized value of sum of squared errors\cite{procrustes-matlab}.  As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dissimilarity}, it is not a good indicator of the transformation as it pertains to the entire network.  This is because the Procrustes algorithm is only performed on the anchor nodes themselves and for those nodes themselves, the transformation is good.

\end{figure}

\section{Outlier Indicators} 

As shown above, there unfortunately no direct indicator that a particular anchor set generates a transformation with an incorrect angle.  Therefore, network planners must avoid all anchor sets that could potentially generate such an angle.  As demonstrated in the Section~\ref{sec:anchorTriangle}, the minimum height of the triangle formed by the anchor nodes is a good indicator of the possibility of a poor transformation angle.  This section presents a metric for how flat of a triangle is too flat.  

Figure~\ref{fig:heightIndicator} plots the minimum
